# 2021
Goodbye 2020 and welcome 2021. 

## For year 2021
I plan to commit to intentions over resolutions. I will...

* listen
* be conversationally neutral and open minded
* have religion be kindness
* contribute more code
* _just_ love life

## For year 2020
Thank you helping me, (us) cherish what is here now, what we have now. Thank you for my wife, and my daughter.
